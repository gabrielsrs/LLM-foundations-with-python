        "# Activity Suggestion Chatbot\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project is a chatbot-based application that suggests personalized activities based on the sentiment and emotion detected in user inputs. By analyzing a user's mood and preferences, the chatbot recommends activities to enhance productivity, relaxation, or mental well-being. If the user is unsatisfied with the suggested activity, the chatbot can generate a new one based on recent user inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "1. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n",
        "    - Uses the **'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english'** model to detect the sentiment of the user input (positive or negative).\n",
        "2. **Emotion Detection**:\n",
        "    - Leverages the **'bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion'** model to identify the user's emotion (e.g., sadness, joy, anger) from the input.\n",
        "3. **Activity Suggestion**:\n",
        "    - Based on the detected sentiment and emotion, the app looks up an appropriate activity from a predefined dataset. The dataset maps different emotions and sentiments to various activities.\n",
        "4. **Regenerate New Activity**:\n",
        "    - If the user wants a different activity, the **'NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'** model generates a new activity based on recent inputs, including user feedback and the previously suggested activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Models Used\n",
        "- **Sentiment Model**:\n",
        "    - **Name**: `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`\n",
        "    - **Purpose**: Analyzes user input to detect sentiment (positive/negative).\n",
        "- **Emotion Model**:\n",
        "    - **Name**: `bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion`\n",
        "    - **Purpose**: Extracts the user's emotional state from the input to guide the chatbot in suggesting a relevant activity.\n",
        "- **Activity Regeneration Model**:\n",
        "    - **Name**: `NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`\n",
        "    - **Purpose**: Generates a new activity suggestion if the user requests one, using previous inputs and context.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The user inputs a message describing their current mood or situation.\n",
        "2. The system first applies sentiment analysis using **'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english'** to classify the sentiment.\n",
        "3. Then, emotion detection is performed using **'bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion'** to identify the emotion behind the message.\n",
        "4. Based on the detected sentiment and emotion, the chatbot looks up an appropriate activity suggestion from a dataset.\n",
        "5. If the user requests another activity, the app will use **'NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'** to generate a fresh activity based on recent inputs and history.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use\n",
        "1. **Input your current mood or situation**:\n",
        "    - Example: \"I've been feeling a bit restless and unproductive lately.\"\n",
        "2. **Receive an activity suggestion**:\n",
        "    - The chatbot will analyze the sentiment and emotion from your input and suggest an activity from the dataset.\n",
        "3. **Regenerate an activity** (Optional):\n",
        "    - If you're not satisfied with the suggestion, you can request a new activity, and the chatbot will generate one based on your recent inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Interaction\n",
        "- **User**:\n",
        "```user\n",
        "Today dragged on with an overwhelming sense of boredom.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "%% Sentiment response %%\n",

        "\n",
        "%% Emotion response %%\n",
        "{'label': 'Sadness', 'score': 0.90478515625}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Chatbot**:\n",
        "```chatbot\n",
        "Talk to a close friend or therapist\n",
        "Please let me know if you want me to generate a new activity based on your input.\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **User**:\n",
        "```user\n",
        "I Wanna another activity.\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Chatbot**:\n",
        "```chatbot\n",
        "Sure! How about we try a new activity? Let's play a game of virtual reality escape room. It's a fun and exciting way to pass the time and challenge your problem-solving skills. Would you like to give it a try?\n",
        "Please let me know if you want me to generate a new activity based on your input.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Installation & Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install dependencies**:\n",
        "    - Install the required libraries using `pip`:\n",
        "        ``\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    !pip install accelerate protobuf sentencepiece torch git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers huggingface_hub gradio\n",
        "\t```\n",
        "1. **Run the app**:\n",
        "    - Launch the Gradio interface to start the chatbot:\n",
        "    ```googlecolab\n",
        "    demo.launch()\n",
        "\t```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Expand the dataset to include a wider variety of activities for different emotional states.\n",
        "- Enhance the context-awareness of the chatbot for better follow-up suggestions.\n",
        "- Add multilingual support to reach a broader audience.\n"
